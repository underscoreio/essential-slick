# Creating and Modifying Data {#Modifying}

In the last chapter we saw how to retrieve data from the database using select queries. In this chapter we will look modifying stored data using insert, update, and delete queries.

SQL veterans will know that update and delete queries, in particular, share many similarities with select queries. The same is true in Slick, where we use the `Query` monad and combinators to build the different kinds of query. Ensure you are familiar with the content of [Chapter 2](#Selecting) before proceeding.
