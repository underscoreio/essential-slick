# Data Modelling {#Modelling}

We can do the basics of connecting to a database, running queries, and changing data. We turn now to richer models of data and how our application hangs together.

In this chapter we will:

- understand how to structure an application;
- look at alternatives to modelling rows as case classes;
- expand on our knowledge of modelling tables to introduce optional values and foreign keys; and
- use custom types to avoid working with just low-level database values.
