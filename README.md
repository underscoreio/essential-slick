## Overview

Essential Slick is a book to get you started building application using the [Slick] database library.
It is aimed at Scala developers who need to become productive with Slick quickly.

It follows a tutorial style and includes exercises.

## Building the Book

This book uses [Underscore's ebook build system][ebook-template].

The simplest way to build the book is to use [Docker Compose](http://docker.com):

- install Docker Compose (`brew install docker-compose` on OS X; or download from [docker.com](http://docker.com/)); and
- run `go.sh` (or `docker-compose run book bash` if `go.sh` doesn't work).

This will open a `bash` shell running inside the Docker container which contains all the dependencies to build the book. From the shell run:

- `npm install`; and then
- `sbt`.

To avoid running out of MetaSpace you'll also want to:

```
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx3g -XX:+TieredCompilation -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=256m -XX:+UseNUMA -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled"
```

Within `sbt` you can issue the commands `pdf`, `html`, `epub`, or `all` to build the desired format(s) of the book. Targets are placed in the `dist` directory.

## Writing

Essential Slick uses [tut] to check the Scala code on the book.
To avoid running out of MetaSpace you'll also want to:

```
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx3g -XX:+TieredCompilation -XX:ReservedCodeCacheSize=256m -XX:+UseNUMA -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled"
```

The source files are in `src/pages`.
The tut converted sources are output to `target/pages`.
